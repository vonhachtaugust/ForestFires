# Does forest fires have phase transitions?

Using a simple java simulation we study how the forest density is related to the size of the developed fire due to a lightning strike.

## Getting Started

There are no external dependencies required in order to play around with the model parameters. The Java code utilizes basic libraries found in any modern java runtime environment (JRE). However, in order to plot the results one needs a plotting tool that can go along with java code.

### Prerequisites

Nothing to install. Add the Java classes to your existing project.

## Running the tests

Currently there are no testing environment.
